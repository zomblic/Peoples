-----> Clicked Link
Work smartered, not harder option!
Go ahead and browse my silly website! I still want to do quite a bit, but once I gain the knowledge needed!



-----> Had to do it the hard way? Really?
In your terminal, the farthest out folder, meaning the folder that contains all the code, open your terminal and type 'npm i'. Wait a few mintues as all the dependencies install, including vite. Still in the terminal, type 'npm run start:dev' it will kickstart and automatically load. Type in the city name and you're done!



  ## <span style="color:rgb(225, 112, 112);">Credits</span>
    To the bootcamp for providing the readme for the assignment,

    Classmates for forming study groups to problem solve and figure it out -- thanks to Nick D for helping with debugging and discussing the code!
    Tutors (Erik and Ainsley) for helping me to try to crack the code and make it stick in my brain.

    Google (and the many, many, many websites that offered advice, tibits and a variety of coding exmaples-- StackOverflow and GeekdforGeeks mainly),
    ChatGPT and Co-Pilot for helping debugging (and making me use a table, instead of mapping)




    And Vs Code!
    
      ... we don't talk about gitbash.
